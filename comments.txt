To test this app, I performed each operation from the dropdown list with the following combinations:
	a nonnumeric input and a numeric input.
	two non-zero numeric inputs, e.g. -20 and 6.22
	A numeric input and as the second input.

Setting the HTML type of the input elements to 'number' restricts the range of characters the user may type into the input textboxes. But non-numeric inputs are still possible, e.g. eee or 1.454..234. When the user types a non-numeric input into either textbox, he receives a warning message that both inputs must be numeric.

Typing in two numbers and selecting an operation from the dropdown list prints the correct result immediately under the second textbox.

Typing in zero as the second input gives a correct result for all non-division operations. For division, the program throws a divide-by-zero exception is thrown and the user is prompted with the text 'Cannot divide by zero'.
